# Traffic Light Project

<b>PIC16F877A</b> has been used in this project, because it is one of microchip 8-bit microcontrollers 
and the most popular one that is used in many applications such as robotics, embedded systems, and 
industrial automation due to its versatility and robust feature set. The term of PIC16F indicates that 
it belongs to the PIC16 series, which is classified as mid-range in Microchip's lineup of 
microcontrollers, the PIC16 series includes microcontrollers with 8-bit data paths and a 14-bit wide 
instruction word, which makes it suitable for a wide range of applications with moderate complexity.
